## Academic bio

I am part of the [Papathanasiou Lab Group](https://www.papathanlab.com/) at the [Sargent Centre for Process Systems Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/process-systems-engineering/), [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemical-engineering/), Imperial College London. 

I am currently working on supply chain optimisation for the [Future Targeted Healthcare Manufacturing Hub](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biochemical-engineering/research/research-and-training-centres/future-targeted-healthcare-manufacturing-hub), and the application of computer-aided tools for optimisation of a wide range of processes, ranging from bioprocesses to energy systems and minerals processing. 

I earned my PhD in Earth Science and Engineering from Imperial College London and my BEng and MSc in Chemical Engineering from Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (Valparaíso, Chile).
