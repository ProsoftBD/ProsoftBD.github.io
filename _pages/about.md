I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Sargent Centre for Process Systems Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/process-systems-engineering/) in the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemical-engineering/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk). 

I received my PhD from the [Department of Earth Science and Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/ese) at Imperial College London, and my BEng and MSc in Chemical Engineering from [Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María](https://www.usm.cl) in Valparaíso, Chile. I am currently working in the [Papathanasiou Lab Group](https://www.papathanlab.com/) on supply chain optimisation for the [Future Targeted Healthcare Manufacturing Hub](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biochemical-engineering/research/research-and-training-centres/future-targeted-healthcare-manufacturing-hub). 

My research interests include the application of computer-aided tools for modelling, control and optimisation of a wide range of processes, ranging from bioprocesses to energy systems and minerals processing:
