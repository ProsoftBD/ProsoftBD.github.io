*Highlights:*

- Novel EMPC strategy using dynamic physics-based froth models is presented.
- Sensitivity analyses support the construction of a robust objective function.
- Objective function includes dynamic air recovery, grade, and steady-state recovery.
- Inclusion of dynamic air recovery dynamic improves flotation performance.
- Simulation results show improvements of 8â€“22% in metallurgical recovery.
